# iTerm

iTerm2 is a replacement for OSX Terminal that does amazing things.

Generally I've shifted over to using Kitty instead (only because it's more cross
platform and provides the sort of font experience I need to support
Operator/Fira Code on Linux systems). However, iterm still has a special place
in my heart and I'll probably install it on most copies of OSX as an improvement
over the default terminal experience.
