# JemBijoux's .dotfiles

As I do more work with the command line it's making more and more sense to put 
some of the configuration into a dotfiles repo so that I can refer to it later.
Also I've started playing more with `vim` and would like to save my progress
(wrt configuration etc). 

This is all a work in progress... (but at least it's versioned and saved)

## .vimrc
Basic vim configuration

Install: $  `ln -s ~/.dotfiles/.vim ~`
Color theme: One Dark

Plugins
- nerdtree: a simple file browser sidebar
- syntastic: syntax highlighting (haven't figured it out yet)
- vim-airline: A nice status bar for vim
- vim-gitgutter: shows git changes in the gutter
- vim-fugitive: lot's of git controls
- command-t: quick fuzzyfinder opener for files
  Had problems installing this because of compilationg problems.
  Just needed to ensure ruby was installed with disable binary, and then
  reinstalled vim.
