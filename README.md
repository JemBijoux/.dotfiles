# JemBijoux's .dotfiles

As I do more work with the command line it's making more and more sense to put 
some of the configuration into a dotfiles repo so that I can refer to it later.
Also I've started playing more with `vim` and would like to save my progress
(wrt configuration etc). 

This is all a work in progress... (but at least it's versioned and saved)

## .vimrc
Basic vim configuration

Install: $  `ln -s ~/.dotfiles/vim/.vimrc ~`
